              harbours, rivers, lakes or inland waterways connected with the
              high seas and navigable by seagoing vessels. Such special rules

              (c) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of

              to additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals

              respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for
              fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional
              station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals shall, so far

              vessel of any special construction or purpose cannot comply with
              the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number,
              position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well
              as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling

                  (i) a vessel intending to overtake another shall in compliance
                  with Rule 9(e)(i) indicate her intention by the following
                  signals on her whistle:

                      “I intend to overtake you on your starboard side”;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      − two prolonged blasts followed by two short blasts to

                  accordance with Rule 9(e)(i) shall indicate her agreement by
                  the following signal on her whistle:

              (d) When vessels in sight of one another are approaching each
              other and from any cause either vessel fails to understand the
              intentions or actions of the other, or is in doubt whether
              sufficient action is being taken by the other to avoid collision,
              the vessel in doubt shall immediately indicate such doubt by
              giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. Such
              signal may be supplemented by a light signal of at least five
              short and rapid flashes.

              (e) A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway
              where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction
              shall sound one prolonged blast. Such signal shall be answered
              with a prolonged blast by any approaching vessel that may be
              within hearing around the bend or behind the intervening
              obstruction.

              (f) If whistles are fitted on a vessel at a distance apart of more
              than 100 meters, one whistle only shall be used for giving
              maneuvering and warning signals.

          <h3>Rule 35 - Sound Signals in Restricted Visibility</h3>
          <ul id="34-list">
            <li>
              In or near an area of restricted visibility, whether by day or
              night, the signals prescribed in this Rule shall be used as
              follows:
            </li>
            <li>
              (a) A power-driven vessel making way through the water shall sound
              at intervals of not more than 2 minutes one prolonged blast.
            </li>
            <li>
              (b) A power-driven vessel underway but stopped and making no way
              through the water shall sound at intervals of not more than 2
              minutes two prolonged blasts in succession with an interval of
              about 2 seconds between them.
            </li>
            <li>
              (c) A vessel not under command, a vessel restricted in her ability
              to maneuver, a vessel constrained by her draft, a sailing vessel,
              a vessel engaged in fishing and a vessel engaged in towing or
              pushing another vessel shall, instead of the signals prescribed in
              paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule, sound at intervals of not more
              than 2 minutes three blasts in succession, namely one prolonged
              followed by two short blasts.
            </li>
            <li>
              (d) A vessel engaged in fishing, when at anchor, and a vessel
              restricted in her ability to maneuver when carrying out her work
              at anchor, shall instead of the signals prescribed in paragraph
              (g) of this Rule sound the signal prescribed in paragraph (c) of
              this Rule.
            </li>
            <li>
              (e) A vessel towed or if more than one vessel is towed the last
              vessel of the tow, if manned, shall at intervals of not more than
              2 minutes sound four blasts in succession, namely one prolonged
              followed by three short blasts. When practicable, this signal
              shall be made immediately after the signal made by the towing
              vessel.
            </li>
            <li>
              (f) When a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are
              rigidly connected in a composite unit they shall be regarded as a
              power-driven vessel and shall give the signals prescribed in
              paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule.
            </li>
            <li>
              (g) A vessel at anchor shall at intervals of not more than one
              minute ring the bell rapidly for about 5 seconds. In a vessel of
              100 meters or more in length the bell shall be sounded in the
              forepart of the vessel and immediately after the ringing of the
              bell the gong shall be sounded rapidly for about 5 seconds in the
              after part of the vessel. A vessel at anchor may in addition sound
              three blasts in succession, namely one short, one prolonged and
              one short blast, to give warning of her position and of the
              possibility of collision to an approaching vessel.
            </li>
            <li>
              (h) A vessel aground shall give the bell signal and if required
              the gong signal prescribed in paragraph (g) of this Rule and
              shall, in addition, give three separate and distinct strokes on
              the bell immediately before and after the rapid ringing of the
              bell. A vessel aground may in addition sound an appropriate
              whistle signal.
            </li>
            <li>
              (i) A vessel of 12 meters or more but less than 20 meters in
              length shall not be obliged to give the bell signals prescribed in
              paragraphs (g) and (h) of this Rule. However, if she does not, she
              shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not
              more than 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              (j) A vessel of less than 12 meters in length shall not be obliged
              to give the above-mentioned signals but, if she does not, shall
              make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more
              than 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              (k) A pilot vessel when engaged on pilotage duty may in addition
              to the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b) or (g) of this
              Rule sound an identity signal consisting of four short blasts.
